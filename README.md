# Hoare Rules for IMP in Agda

A small experiment on Hoare expressions for the IMP language in Agda.

Mainly for my own amusement; I would not recommend using this unless you enjoy fighting with the Agda typechecker.

The definitions are written, but my example is incomplete, as convincing Agda two 'different' types are actually the same (after some computation) is arduous.
